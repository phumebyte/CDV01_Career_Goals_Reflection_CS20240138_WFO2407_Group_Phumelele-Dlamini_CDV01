    - My career aspirations harmoniously blend my budding familiarity with front-end development and user based technologies.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
   - To achieve my first short term goal of becoming employable at a software development company, I must build projects that will go on my portfolio and contribute to other open source projects on platforms like GitHub. I will actively apply to internships and seek a mentor. To increase my skill levels I can participate in hackathons and use freeCodeCamp as practice.
   - To obtain a java certification, I will enrol in a udemy course in the next year and purchase practice exams. I will try gain hands-on experience by solving code problems on platforms like LeetCode then all that is left to do is register and write the exam.
     
2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Achieving my long-term goal of merging software engineering with psychology to become a cognitive scientist in AI requires dedicated effort. I need to deepen my expertise in psychology through advanced coursework, while also mastering AI and machine learning techniques. Developing interdisciplinary skills that integrate psychological theories with AI technologies is crucial for creating human-centered AI models.
    - I need a degree in human psychology, an advanced understanding of AI models and to further my studies, a qualification in Cognitive Sciences. I need to ensure I am skilled in research based work and technical communication, AI frameworks and an understanding of front-end and user based technologies.
